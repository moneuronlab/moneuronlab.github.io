**Weâ€™re a team of scientists, researching and studying collaboratively.**

[We](https://moneuronlab.github.io/team) are dedicated to fostering an environment where scientific inquiry and collaborative learning thrive. Through regular online sessions, we explore a wide range of scientific topics, from in-depth discussions on recent developments to focused study sessions on key neuroscience concepts.

Our approach combines structured discussions with collaborative learning. We hold themed scientific discussions where members share insights, analyze recent research, and engage in critical dialogue. We also dedicate time to deep study to ensure that everyone stays on track with their learning and understanding of the field.

In addition to our discussions, we are committed to exploring the intersections of neuroscience, coding, and data science. This includes building skills in computational neuroscience, with the aim of applying what we learn to complex research challenges.

By combining collective knowledge and diverse perspectives, we strive to advance our understanding of neuroscience and contribute meaningfully to the scientific community.
