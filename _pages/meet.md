### **Session 1: Scientific Discussion (Mandatory)**
This is our core session, and everyone is required to attend. Here's how it will go:
- **Theme**: We’ll discuss a specific scientific topic that has been voted on by the group. Make sure to stay tuned for the theme announcement!
- **Format**: Everyone will get **5 minutes** to share their thoughts based on what they’ve read, seen, or heard about the topic.
- **Questions**: Feel free to write your questions in the chat as others present. At the end, we’ll address the questions and dive deeper into the discussion.
  
### **Session 2: Textbook Study (Optional but Recommended)**
This session will be held **1 hour after Session 1** and is designed to help us stay on track with our studies.
- **Textbook**: We’ll be voting on the textbook soon, but **Kandel's Principles of Neuroscience** has been a popular suggestion so far.
- **Format**: Each session, one person will lead by sharing their screen and going through the designated chapter. You’ll know in advance which chapter you’re responsible for.
- **Preparation**: Everyone should read the assigned material at home during the week, and the session will be a time to clarify concepts, discuss ideas, and ensure we’re all on the same page.

### **Session 3: Computational Neuroscience + Data Science (Optional)**
This will be our **learning-focused session** and is geared towards those who are interested in diving deeper into computational neuroscience, coding, and data science.
- **Format**: We’ll be learning together and gradually building up to a computational approach in neuroscience.
- **Commitment**: While this session is optional, if you choose to join, we ask that you commit to attending for the rest of the program. Consistency will be key as we learn these new skills.

### **Important Notes:**
- We’ll be **documenting everything**, so don’t worry if you miss something during the sessions.
- **Topic Selection**: We will continue to choose topics for each month’s discussions through voting. Keep an eye out for those polls.
- **Planning**: We’re working on a chart that will outline our monthly plans and specify chapter assignments for each person. This will help us all stay organized.
